Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: anyone, but after three predictiosn the program use more time to predict so, the process was a little slowly

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: after three predictions the time is good but from 10000 the predictios take more tima almost the double of time or little more
